This repository keeps project files of *'Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project'*. 

The data set is on wearable computing, and is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. It can be accessed from this link: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

'CodeBook.md' is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data. 

'run_analysis.R' is the main R code to clean up, filter, and calculate the mean and average of variables from the data.
To obtain the output, download the whole repository, set the working directory to the directory holding 'run_analysis.R' file. In R studio, enter command: 'source("run_analysis.txt")'. 

'averages_Activity_Subject.txt' is the final output of cleaned data.
